WASA-SED Model
--------------
WASA-SED is a numerical model for simulation hydrological and sediment fluxes from meso-scale catchments (Mueller et al., 2010).
This repository contains documentation, sample data set and source code.
All rights under the stated license (see license.txt) of the WASA-SED code are with the SESAM-Project and successors, c/o Till Francke, Universität Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14473 Potsdam, Germany, please contact: francke@uni-potsdam.de).

******************************
WASA-SED is a large and complex hydrological and sediment transport model. It is not a polished point-and-click GUI tool. Extensive knowledge of its design, purpose, and limitations is required in order to apply it properly. See license.txt for terms of use.
******************************
The source-code (SVN-rev. 134) has successfully been compiled with Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6, Intel Fortran XE 14.0, gfortran 4.4 and pgfortran 10.9-0.
Please see Makefile* for necessary flags.
